Nest.js is a popular open-source framework for building efficient, scalable, and enterprise-grade server-side applications in JavaScript using Node.js. 

___TypeScript___

Nest.js uses TypeScript, which provides optional static typing and improved code readability.

___Dependency Injection___

Nest.js uses dependency injection to provide modularity, testing, and scalability.

___Fast Performance___

Nest.js is built on top of the powerful Node.js platform, providing fast performance and efficient resource utilization.

___Microservices Support___

Nest.js provides an easy way to develop and manage microservices, enabling developers to break down complex applications into smaller, more manageable components.

___Testing Support___

Nest.js provides a testing module that makes it easy to write tests and ensures the reliability of applications.

___Large Community___

Nest.js has a large and active community of developers, providing support and a wealth of resources and tutorials.

___DevTool___

View your app as a graph and more - Not free!

___Modular architecture___

Nest.js enables developers to organize their code into modular blocks, making it easier to maintain and reuse code.

Controller: Handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client.

Provider: May be treated as a provider â€“ services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on. The main idea of a provider is that it can be injected as a dependency; this means objects can create various relationships with each other.

Module: A class annotated with a @Module() decorator. The @Module() decorator provides metadata that Nest makes use of to organize the application structure.
